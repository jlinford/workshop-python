This directory contains some example codes for use in the TAU workshop. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1: Before starting on Yellowstone, please use:
% source /glade/apps/opt/ParaTools/tau/tau.bashrc (or .cshrc)
to set the environment variables on Surface.llnl.gov

This will set up the modules and paths for this workshop. It is also needed to locate some tools (Scalasca, VampirTrace) for trace processing. 

To run the jobs simple edit the run.job:
#BSUB -P SORE0001        # project code
and use your project code.

% bsub < workshop/run.job 
on the other Linux systems.

We recommend reading the README file in each subdirectory and trying the 
commands to generate and analyze the data. 

1) matmult - a simple Fortran MPI program for matrix multiplication.
2) mm - a simple C MPI program for matrix multiplication. Can use pthread, OpenMP, and/or MPI.
3) ring - a simple Fortran MPI program for sending a message in a ring.
4) cthreads - C with pthreads
5) NPB3.1 - shows instrumentation in C and Fortran applications using MPI. 
6) NPB3.3-MZ-MPI - shows instrumentation in C and Fortran applications using MPI with OpenMP. 
7) memoryleakdetect - an example of using TAU for detecting memory leaks in F90, C/C++ programs.
8) opari - shows how OpenMP applications can be profiled with TAU.
9) papi - loop level instrumentation and use of hardware performance counters
10) sweep3d - a parallel Fortran MPI application. Illustrates use of Scalasca/Expert for automatically detecting bottlenecks.
mpirun -np 16 ./matmult

NOTE 3:
These examples assume tcsh/csh as your shell. If you are using bash, please use:

% export TAU_MAKEFILE=<value>
% export PATH=$PATH:<dir>

instead of 

% setenv TAU_MAKEFILE <value>
% set path=($path <dir>)
